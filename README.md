The Baybayin script has become increasingly popular as a result of social media and people's desire to reconnect with their roots. However, even though many people know how to read Baybayin correctly, some incorrect uses occur, meaning that the words or phrases are spelled incorrectly and awkwardly. The Philippine Congress has approved House Bill 1022, which states that Bayb√°yin will be used as the country's national writing system. With the approval of this House Bill, the Department of Education and National Commission for Culture and Arts has vowed to reintroduce this old writing system to the country.
